# Bank Statement Fidelity Editor — container image for headless deployment.
#
# This image runs the *additive* `serve` subcommand (HTTP health surface +
# the existing worker runtime). It does NOT change the GUI/CLI architecture.
#
# All legacy Python, PyMuPDF, and pdfium dependencies have been removed,
# relying exclusively on the native Rust stack (oxidize-pdf, etc).
